We like the look of your skillset - and are interested in giving you a project.

Before we give you the project, we would love if you could spend a little bit of time to build an app based on some PSD designs we will provide you - to see your skillset, timeframe and quality of code.

If you can set this up using Vue and Quasar framework that would be ideal.

It can be without logic and some functions - but containing navigation between pages and the sidebar.

Once you are done can you please upload to https://www.installonair.com for us, you can add our UDID to the build (00008020-001120CA026A002E) for iPhone please.

Most of our apps have a similar flavour as we use the same designer usually - you can see an example of our apps attached here.

Also our apps typically include a backend admin panel to manage aspects of the app which looks something like the following link - https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6s77km1dlpfr0zp/AADQnRTQAuofqSbVMNf_V_yna?dl=0 - just so you have an idea of our flavour of our apps/systems.

We have a few projects lined up and ready - and looking to form long term relationships with you.

We currently have two full stack developers from Ukraine/Russia on board.

Sound good?
